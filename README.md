# Resumé versioning automation
Convert your resumé automatically into PDF and docx formats on save. Keep a record of the changes you've made to your resumé for each employer you submit it to.

## How to use
- Update [name.txt](../blob/main/name.txt) with your name with an underscore between first, last: `First_Last`. This will be the name of the PDF and docx files, followed by `_resume`.

- Update [resume.md](../blob/main/resume.md) with your desired content.

- Commit the changes either to a new branch or main, the corresponding PDF and docx files will be updated in the output directory.

- Download the files as needed
